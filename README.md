A PS Vita port of the game Fanwor by Thomas Huth.<br>
Forked from: <https://git.tuxfamily.org/fanwor/fanwor.git>

Check **readme.txt** if you want to read the original readme file.

## How to build

[VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/) is needed. After you've set it correctly, clone the repository.<br>
Enter the project directory and build it like this:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

It will generate the .vpk file inside the build folder.
